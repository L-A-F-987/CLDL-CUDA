# Deep Neural Filter Hearing Aid

 The objective of this project was to design a real-time adaptive noise canceling hearing aid style device. Unlike conventional hearing aids, this hearing aid used a neural network (Deep neural filter) libary written by Dr Bernd Porr at University of Glasgow. 
 
# Prerequisites

 A CUDA-enabled GPU is required to use this library.
 
 The CUDA developer toolkit is required to compile and run the library.

 Tested with CUDA-10.2 on a Jetson Nano Dev Kit
